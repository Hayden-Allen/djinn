- questions
	- reset ids on scene switch?
	- enforce all pos/rot/scale changes be done in __main?
	- mesh_instance dirty flag/call mesh_instance_batch::update when transform changed?

- now
	- s_num_ubos/s_transforms_per_ubo
		- sync these values between mesh_instance_batch and shaders (preprocessor, always use minimum?)
	- instance shaders
		- per-instance struct
		- preprocessor to compile with maximum array size of this struct
		- struct names and data types are extracted from shader after compilation
		- batches have their own shaders
		- when an instance is created, you give it shader id. appropriate batch is selected or created,
			and that instance gets a structure containing the correct per-instance uniforms for that shader
		- dirty flag on instance transform
		- visibility mask (Scene.MeshInstance.setVisible) camera mask?
	- mesh_instance_manager::destroy broken
	- move to mgl::layer system
	- input_service takes layer to get access to input_cache
	- set camera uniforms automatically in Render.draw

- soon
	- framebuffer_u8/f32?
	- deferred renderer
	- scene graph

- later
	- mesh_manager::load (formats? animation?)
	- asset_manager::load_mesh
	- mesh_watcher
	- mesh_manager::reload/rename
	- physics_manager/physics_service
		- set transform functions
		- Physics.copyTransformTo(idHitbox, idSceneObject) this is how physics world drives entity transforms
	- load powertranzphormr scenes
	- distribution asset pipeline
	- virtual filesystem
	- release build (remove watchers, change asserts, etc)

- even later
	- per-camera effects
	- audio_manager/audio_watcher

- !important
	- global GL_* constants in js?
	- on app exit, throw error if assets not destroyed
