- questions
	- reset ids on scene switch?
	- mesh_instance dirty flag/call mesh_instance_batch::update when transform changed?
	- Scene.destroySelf()?
	- HOT_RELOAD/NOT_RELOAD macro?
	- animation jumping on loop?
	- do shader math in camera space to avoid artifacts?

- now
- physics
	- slowly fall off platform
	- physics_object_manager::update order needs to respect scene graph?
		- physics only subgraph?
- graphics
	- mesh_instance_batch testing
		- create instances with different shaders
		- removing works at all
		- removing instance at capacity threshold deletes now-unused ubo
		- removing all instances using a shader deletes that instance
	- mesh layers
	- wing spaz
	- wonky goofy debug draw
- other
	- rewrite main.ts
	- xport hot reload
	- scripts OOP stl
	- casting sptr<T> to sptr<U>, where T derives from U AND at least one other type, doesn't work properly (correct byte offset to second base class not applied, not sure why)



- later
	- powertranzphormr mgl::input_file => haul::input_file
	- load/save take haul::input_file* const
	- retained_buffer::load => buffer::load (buffer doesn't get save though)
	- mesh_watcher_base/static_mesh_watcher/animated_mesh_watcher
	- script error reporting system (no ASSERTs)



- even later
	- framebuffer_u8/f32?
	- deferred renderer
	- multiple cameras
	- visibility mask (Scene.MeshInstance.setVisible) camera mask?
	- move to mgl::layer system
	- distribution asset pipeline
	- virtual filesystem



- latest
	- per-camera effects
