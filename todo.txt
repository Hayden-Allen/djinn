- asset service
	- exposes these to scripts:
		- audio (load)
		- texture (load/create)
		- shader (load)
		- mesh (load/create)
	- each has a watcher for hot reloading
	- each has own ids (size_t)
	- each has own *_manager and *_watcher
		- manager supports creating, loading/reloading, renaming, destroying
		- watcher monitors fs and notifies manager when something changes
		- all of this is abstracted from scripts; scripts just use id that is bound
			to these assets under the hood (automatically "get" changes)
		- managers own assets
