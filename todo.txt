- questions
	- reset ids on scene switch?
	- enforce all pos/rot/scale changes be done in __main?
	- mesh_instance dirty flag/call mesh_instance_batch::update when transform changed?

- now
	- s_num_ubos/s_transforms_per_ubo
		- INSTANCE_TYPE, INSTANCE_FIELD, #define d_instance
		- sync these values between mesh_instance_batch and shaders (preprocessor, always use minimum?)
		- preprocessor to compile with maximum array size of instance struct
	- miniaudio include
	- mesh_instance_batch testing
		- create instances with different shaders
		- removing works at all
		- removing instance at capacity threshold deletes now-unused ubo
		- removing all instances using a shader deletes that instance

- later
	- m3d
	- physics_manager/physics_service
		- set transform functions
		- Physics.copyTransformTo(idHitbox, idSceneObject) this is how physics world drives entity transforms
	- load powertranzphormr scenes

- later
	- framebuffer_u8/f32?
	- deferred renderer
	- scene graph/multiple cameras
	- visibility mask (Scene.MeshInstance.setVisible) camera mask?
	- move to mgl::layer system
	- distribution asset pipeline
	- virtual filesystem

- even later
	- per-camera effects
